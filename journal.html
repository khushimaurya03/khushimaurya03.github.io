<li>coming back to Salesforce Training </li>
<li>We started Triggers today. </li>

<li><strong>Triggers are basically which automatically invokes whenever a special event in database occurs.</strong></li>
<li>Before and After triggers with 7 different kind of events took the place in my notebook.</li>
<li> Before and After are just two words, but between these words time is unlimited which I came to know in this session of 4hrs.</li>
<li>So basically what happened is, Triggers triggered stress.</li>
<li>No, it wasn't tough but kind of, but not really ...still it turned off my mind at the end.</li>

<li>And in the end , we were asked to write journal as usual.</li>

<li>Okay so, it was a sudden meeting (not for everyone but for me)... </li>
<li>We did some installations including JDK and ANT</li>
<li>And we have to do some CTRL+C and CTRL+V for the paths, still I was not able to do that, ah shame!</li>

<li>No No, not that easy as we were instructed to not change the system settings, so experiments would have complicated the things.</li>

<li>And as it was done, we were given task to make some calculations in java programming language itself for practice.</li>

<p>Always thought cloud was what we see in the sky and when it is about to rain it turn black but whatever, we were a small child back then, who knew that<b> "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers".</b></p>
<ul><li>So what i got to know is; well give it a look to other points too.</li>
<li>This part tells me to go through these topics which are:
<ul><li>Learn about the Cloud, Cloud Computing</li>
<li>After that I need to know about the customer-company relationship CRM, leads and how to deploy apps on salesforce.</li>
<li>Ah, storing these data is got to be tough for us small people who wants to wander in the mountains;  taking all these data over our shoulder is really hard and not to disclose to every other people.So what we need is to form a object, that's it.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>This part is gonna remind me that i have to do an asssignment to create objects .</li></ul>
