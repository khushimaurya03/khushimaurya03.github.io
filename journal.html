<p>Always thought cloud was what we see in the sky and when it is about to rain it turn black but whatever, we were a small child back then, who knew that<b> "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers".</b></p>
<ul><li>So what i got to know is; well give it a look to other points too.</li>
<li>This part tells me to go through these topics which are:
<ul><li>Learn about the Cloud, Cloud Computing</li>
<li>After that I need to know about the customer-company relationship CRM, leads and how to deploy apps on salesforce.</li>
<li>Ah, storing these data is got to be tough for us small people who wants to wander in the mountains;  taking all these data over our shoulder is really hard and not to disclose to every other people.So what we need is to form a object, that's it.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>This part is gonna remind me that i have to do an asssignment to create objects .</li></ul>
